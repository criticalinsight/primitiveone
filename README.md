Setup
-----

The following pre-requisites should be in place for the theme to work:

1. WordPress install of version 5.0 or later
2. Have pretty permalinks activated

Optional
3. Register a domain
4. Set homepage to a static page (optional but I've not tried as starndard blog)
5. Posts permalink set set to: Custom Structure e.g. - `/blog/%postname%/`


If deploying to Vercel the current Frontity reccomendation is to install WordPress to a sub directory i.e. wp.example.com dedicated domain
